# Auction
<b>Like e-commerce auction site that will allow users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a “watchlist.”<b>
## Active Listings Page: 
The default route of my web application is active listing page users can view all of the currently active auction listings. For each active listing, this page display the title, description, current price, photo, a filter option that filter on basis of houses and a watch button that take it to watch page.
