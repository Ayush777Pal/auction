# Auction
<b>Like e-commerce auction site that will allow users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a “watchlist.”<b>
## Active Listings Page: 
The default route of my web application is active listing page users can view all of the currently active auction listings. For each active listing, this page display the title, description, current price, photo, a filter option that filter on basis of houses and a watch button that take it to watch page.

## Listing/Watch Page:
Clicking on a "Watch" take users to a page specific to that listing. On that page, can view 
<ul>
  <li>All details about the listing, including the current price for the listing.</li>
  <li>If the user is signed in</li>
  <ul>
      <li> The user is able to add the item to their “Watchlist.” If the item is already on the watchlist, the user should be able to remove it.</li>
  <li> The user is able to bid on the item. The bid must be at least as large as the starting bid, and must be greater than any other bids that have been placed </li>
    <li>If the user is the one who created the listing, the user has the ability to “close” the auction from this page, which makes the highest bidder the winner of the auction and makes the listing no longer active.</li>
    <li>Users are able to add comments to the listing page. The listing page should display all comments that have been made on the listing.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
